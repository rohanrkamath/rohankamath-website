                    <b><i>Abstract━ </i></b> In this modern age of information, the answer to
                    any particular question is readily available on the internet. The
                    chronology of the solution to open-domain question-answering
                    capabilities is primitive manual question mining, followed by
                    search engine revolution. Later, intelligent assistants became a
                    robust method, which is being used for a long time. However,
                    it has been noticed that the intelligent assistant responds to
                    simple questions but not to the complicated ones that demand
                    comprehension of the question’s abstract. This paper introduces
                    an innovative, dynamic technique called CATAQ, i.e., Concise
                    Answer To Any Question, that responds to complicated questions
                    by providing accurate answers. Furthermore, CATAQ introduces
                    a solution for dynamic information retrieval, which involves the
                    selection of the most appropriate webpage links, based on the link
                    parsing the content of the webpage irrespective of its structure,
                    pre-processing the content, extracting the pertinent information
                    with semantic search and summarizing by prioritizing question’s
                    keywords. <br>
                    It is observed that CATAQ outperformed the present intelligent
                    assistants while answering complex questions which include an
                    unusual and large variety of topics and keeping the performance
                    consistent while answering simple questions. Concluding, CATAQ
                    can answer any question concisely, assuming the related information
                    is available on the internet.

                    <b><i>Abstract━ </i></b> With the rapid growth of social media platforms such as
                        Twitter, propaganda has become rampant. However, the state-of-the-art
                        models in the eld of propaganda research are limited to datasets of
                        formal linguistic construct, such as news articles. But social media conversations
                        such as tweets are characterised by the heavy usage of informal
                        language. Hence, most of the text-based models developed on news articles
                        do not perform well on socio-linguistic datasets. Also, emotions play
                        an important role in propaganda as there is a direct correlation of emotions
                        with various textual propaganda constructs. Hence, in this paper,
                        we propose a methodology that combines a structure-aware pivot-based
                        language model for domain adaptation with emotional footprints in the
                        text data towards eective propaganda detection in social media dataset.

                    <b><i>Description━ </i></b> 
                    The Citizenship Amendment Act (Bill) agitation, also known as the CAA Protest,
                     began after the Government of India established the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) on December 12, 2019. 
                     These protests saw a lot of activity on news articles and social media Twitter that had propaganda. Thus,
                    <ol>
                        <li>464 news articles split sentence-wise and classified as propaganda or not,</li>
                        <li>597 tweets manually annotated considering 18 propaganda techniques were collected as a part of a domain adaptation task performed by the authors.</li>
                    </ol>
                    This dataset was created and implemented in the paper "Emotion Enhanced Domain Adaptation for
                    Propaganda Detection in Indian Social Media".
